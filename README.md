# Wordle Game
Welcome to the Word Game! This is a game where you try to guess a randomly generated word within a certain number of attempts.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Word Game, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play
When you open the Word Game, you will be presented with a randomly generated word that you need to guess. The length of the word is displayed at the top of the game board. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

To make a guess, simply click on the letters of the alphabet at the bottom of the game board. If a letter you select is in the word you are trying to guess, it will appear in the corresponding position on the game board. If a letter you select is not in the word, it will not appear on the game board.

As you make guesses, the letters you have guessed correctly will appear in green, letters that are in the word but in the wrong position will appear in yellow, and letters that are not in the word will appear in black. If you run out of attempts before guessing the word correctly, the game will end and you will be given the option to play again.
